CutieFont is a TrueType font with embedded color images, like emoji fonts, except instead of emoji it contains Cutie Marks! The version named **CutieFont.ttf.sbix.ttf** works only with Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or later. The version named **CutieFont.ttf.svg.ttf** will work with Mozilla Firefox and will soon work with Adobe CC and Windows 10.

The font was generated by FontForge, but since FontForge does not support embedded color images, they had to be injected into the generated font using [Kreative BitsNPicas](https://github.com/kreativekorp/bitsnpicas).
